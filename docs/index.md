# Apertium-fin-krl–Finnish–Karelian dictionary and RBMT resources

Apertium-fin-krl is a free and open source project containing lexical resources
and some rules, primarily developed for rule-based machine translation, but
can be useful to anyone needing bi-lingual resources for the language pair.
The dictionaries and rulesets are provided in apertium's own XML format.

### Basics

Everyone should read at least the usage information from the README of the
project and apertium wiki for further information on apertium.
